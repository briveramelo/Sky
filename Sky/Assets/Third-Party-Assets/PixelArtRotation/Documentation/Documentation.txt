Introduction
Pixel art Rotation is a tool for Unity 2D 5.* that allows you to transform the pixels inside a Sprite creating a rotation that maintains the principles of pixel art without rotating the whole Sprite as Unity does.

This document will guide you through the basics of Pixel art Rotation to show you how to properly use it. Along with the asset we include a demo scene with a small example of what can be done with this tool.

Installation
Pixel art Rotation installation is as simple as any other asset in the Unity Store, just download it from inside Unity 5.*, select at least the PixelArtRotation folder to add the asset to your project. The rest is the documentation and the demo scene.


Rotating a Sprite
To start with Pixel Art Rotation you have to create a sprite of a size big enough to contain the original sprite and its animation as well as room for all the possible rotations. See the Important Note for more information.

Then the sprite has to be imported as an Advanced texture, and enable the Read/Write option to allow the asset to read the pixels of the sprite. The pivot of the sprite will also determine the pivot of the rotation so if you want to rotate the sprite from the center you would place the pivot, inside the Sprite Editor, in the center:

Then set the image to the SpriteRenderer of the GameObject and add the Pixel Rotation script. In the Editor set the correct Filter mode and Pixels per Unit. If you want to animate the character do it as you normally would in 2D. And it’s done.

Now you can change the angle of the sprite by changing directly the corresponding property in the Editor or by accessing the Angle property through scripting.


Important note
Currently Pixel Art Rotation only supports sprites whose size is a square with enough room to allow the rotation of the image inside them, it means that the sprite in Unity will act as a canvas for the rotation and animation., this can be seen in the files attached to the demo scenes. We’re working in a possible solution for this.
